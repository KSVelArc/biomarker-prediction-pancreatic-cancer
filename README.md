Biomarker-Based Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer
===============================================
`Keila Velazquez-Arcelay`

We want to predict pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using a biomarker panel (LYVE1, REG1A, REG1B, and TFF1) tested on urine samples and plasma CA19_9. This type of cancer is one of the deadliest due to its typical late onset of symotpoms at later stages of the disease. While it is ranked 11th in incidence by the NIH, it is ranked 4th in deaths ([Cancer Stat Facts: Common Cancer Sites](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/common.html)). For that reason, a test based on biomarkers could facilitate early detection and help save lives.
